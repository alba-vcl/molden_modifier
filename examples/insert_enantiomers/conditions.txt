- Here the desired output is "total.molden" which is the structures.molden
  and enantiomers.molden together ordered by energy

- The file enantiomers.molden are obtained from structures.molden. I donÂ´t
  have the code of the script but it is the result of multiply every coordinate
  by -1, like a "mirror" image of the structure.

- Usually I generate the enantiomers.molden with the script. This script gives
  the new names adding the prefix "enant" for every structure and after I use
  "cat" to join the files, finally I order the structures by energy or paste
  every enantiomer below his original structure.
